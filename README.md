Have fun playing a classic Snake game built with Python and Pygame.  
It includes single‑player, two‑player, **Player vs AI** modes, selectable difficulty, smart AI options, mystery power‑ups, procedurally generated sound, and a persistent scoreboard.

## ✨ Features

- 👤👥🤖 **Game modes:** Single‑player, two‑player, and Player vs AI on a shared 30×30 grid
- 🧠 **AI difficulty:**
  - 🟢 **Easy** – greedy AI that sometimes moves randomly
  - 🔵 **Smart** – BFS‑based AI that actively avoids the invincible player
- ⚡ **Invincibility rule:** when you’re invincible, the AI snake **dies** if it hits you
- 🎮 **Game difficulty:**
  - 🟩 **Normal** – classic play
  - 🟥 **Hard** – reshuffling obstacles appear with each fruit eaten
- 🎁 **Mystery boxes** appear periodically and grant one of three random effects:
  - 🌈 **Colour change** – temporary invincibility + wall wrap
  - 🍎 **Fruit pack** – +5 length and +5 score
  - ⚡ **Speed boost** – move twice as fast
- 🏆 **Hall of Fame** – top 10 scores saved locally, with 🥇🥈🥉 medals and 1P/2P badges
- 🔊 **Procedural sound** – no external audio files needed
- 🏁 Win by filling the entire board

## 📋 Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🎮 Pygame

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Running

```bash

## ⚙️ For Pro Users

You can easily tweak the game’s behaviour by editing src/config.py:

Mystery box frequency – find the line and change the number (in milliseconds). Lower values = boxes spawn more often.

```
MYSTERY_BOX_INTERVAL = 10000
```

<a id="random-chance-tweak"></a>
Feel free to decrease the `random_chance` variable in [line 116 of src/ai.py](src/ai.py#L116) to make the greedy AI slightly stronger.
```
def __init__(self, random_chance=0.2):
```
To make the appearance of the mystery box completely random and different each time edit line 348 of src/game.py
```
and current_time - self.last_mystery_box_time > MYSTERY_BOX_INTERVAL # You can change this to random.randint(500,15000)
```

Snake speed – find the line and decrease the value to make the snake move faster. You can also adjust FPS for smoother animation.
```
BASE_MOVE_DELAY = 120
```

Feel free to experiment! All changes are safe – just restart the game to see them in action.

## How the ai's work
1. Greedy: At each move the greedy AI calculates the Manhattan distance to the fruit and tries to dodge the human player. The AI makes a list of possible safe moves; if several are possible, it randomly chooses the one that minimizes the distance. At a fixed ratio addressed in [this section](#random-chance-tweak), it ignores the fruit entirely and picks a random safe move – making it playful, unpredictable, and beatable.

2. BFS (Smart): Instead of one-step greed, this AI performs a Breadth-First Search from its head to the fruit, avoiding walls, its own body, the player, and obstacles. It finds the shortest safe path, then takes the first step along that path. If no safe path exists (e.g., it's trapped), it falls back to the greedy-with-random behavior. Like the greedy AI, it also prioritizes fleeing when the human is invincible. This makes the BFS AI far more strategic, but still vulnerable when cornered or when the board gets crowded.
